    "1. Problem Statement: Form a title and problem statement that clearly state the problem\n",
    "and questions you are trying to answer. Additionally:\n",
    "    - Discuss the background of the problem leading to your objectives.\n",
    "Why is it a significant problem?\n",
    "    - Explain the potential of your project to contribute to your problem\n",
    "domain. Discuss why this contribution is crucial?\n",
    "2. Data Sources : Collect your data. Your data can come from multiple sources.\n",
    "    - For example, Medical, Bank, sports, health, Kaggle, Amazon reviews, Twitter, Youtube, Reddit, etc. \n",
    "    - This data has to be large enough for the data analysis to yield significance. At least 2000 rows.\n",
    "3. Data Cleaning/Processing: Your dataset has to be cleaned and properly\n",
    "processed. Please submit a report where you explain each processing/cleaning step\n",
    "properly. We expect to see comments and markup for this step. \n",
    "    - In order to get full marks you must clearly document 7 (10 for 587 students) distinct processing/cleaning operations.\n",
    "4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform exploratory data analysis as\n",
    "defined in the NIST publication [2] and as originally described by John Tukey [4,5].\n",
    "Record the outcomes and what you learned and how you will use this information.\n",
    "    - For example, in choosing features (columns) and dropping columns, and in short feature engineering. \n",
    "    - You need to demonstrate 7 (10 for 587 students) different, significant and relevant EDA operations and describe how you used these to process the data sets further to provision them for downstream modeling and analytics. Figures and tables should be included where relevant.\n"
