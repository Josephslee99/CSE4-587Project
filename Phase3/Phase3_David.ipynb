    "In Phase 3, you will be building a data product from your Phase 2 models which would allow a user to interact with your models to gain insight into the data/problem statement you set out to solve. This could be as simple as allowing a user to input their own dataset for automatic analysis, or something more complicated tailored to your particular problem domain. The deliverables for Phase 3 will include your entire project code and documentation, as well as a short demo video showing your completed product.\n",

    "This phase involves building a data product that automates and parameterizes the process you established in Phases 1 and 2. This could be a web-application, mobile app, or enterprise application to allow users /clients to interact with it. Deliverables will include the code for your entire project, including the data product, complete with documentation, as well as a demo video showing off the product.\n",

Allow a health professional to enter observations about a patient, and have your product give them some sort of feedback about the likelihood that the patient in question has the disease, perhaps some extra information about factors that have the strongest impact on this prediction etc. Trying to determine how many appointments for a given schedule will actually be kept?
